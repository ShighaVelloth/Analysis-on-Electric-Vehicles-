# Analysis-on-Electric-Vehicles

This project focuses on analyzing electric vehicle (EV) registration data through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to derive meaningful insights. The dataset contains various attributes such as vehicle make, model year, electric range, and Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility, providing a comprehensive view of the EV landscape across different locations.

The project employs multiple data analysis techniques:

Univariate Analysis: This includes visualizations like histograms, box plots, and pie charts to understand the distribution of individual variables, such as the distribution of model years and the proportion of CAFV eligibility among vehicles.

Bivariate Analysis: We explore relationships between two variables, such as the electric range across different vehicle makes, helping to identify which brands offer the highest electric ranges.

Advanced Visualization: The project includes the creation of a choropleth map to visualize the geographical distribution of EVs and a racing bar plot to animate the evolution of EV counts by make over time.

Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values: Missing data is handled using appropriate imputation techniques to ensure robust analysis, while summary statistics provide an overview of the datasetâ€™s key numerical features.
